<img alt="Logo" src="graphics/icon.webp" width="120" />


Fossify Messages is your trusted messaging companion, designed to enhance your messaging experience in various ways.
**The above is the official fossify message links however in my fork the following changes**<br><br><br>
**1. Build & Compatibility Fixes**<br>
• **Resolved Build Error 25**: Added --enable-native-access, --add-opens, and -XX:+UseParallelGC to gradle.properties to ensure compatibility with Gradle 8.13 and JDK 21. This is personal preference<br>
• **Robust APK Signing**: Updated app/build.gradle.kts to automatically detect signing credentials from your global ~/.gradle/gradle.properties using SIGNING_ snake_case naming conventions.<br>
• **Warning Cleanup**: Fixed various deprecation warnings in Context.kt (Glide into calls) and resolved unresolved references during the build process.<br><br>
**2. New Feature**s: OTP & Transaction Automation<br>
• **OTP Detection**: Created OTPDetector.kt to identify verification codes. The app now automatically copies OTPs to the clipboard and plays a dedicated otp.mp3 sound (the present audio file is my daughter SAYING PAPPA OTP 😍). Once everything is stable I'll update to other tone.<br>
• **Smart Transaction Announcements**:<br>
◦ Added TransactionDetector.kt to parse debit/credit alerts from major banks (Axis, HDFC, IDFC, Kotak, Federal, etc.).<br>
◦ Implemented a Singleton TTSHelper to announce transactions out loud (e.g., "Paid 100 rupees to Amazon from HDFC bank").<br>
◦ **SSML Integration**: Uses Speech Synthesis Markup Language for expressive and natural-sounding announcements (e.g., higher pitch for interest, emphasis on recipients).<br>
◦ **Statement Filtering**: Intelligent detection to skip non-transactional messages like bill generation or "minimum due" alerts.<br>
• **TTS Customization**: Added interactive sliders in Settings to adjust speech speed and pitch to your preference.<br>
• **Dedicated Notification Channels**: Created separate Android notification channels for OTP and Transactions to allow for independent customization and audio routing.<br><br>
**3. App Functionality Enhancements**<br>
• **Customizable Swipe Actions**: Added support for left and right swipe actions in the conversation list. Users can choose between "Mark as Read/Unread", "Delete", or "Archive" for each direction.<br>
• **Mute Indicators**: Muted conversations now display a visual indicator in the main list, allowing you to easily identify silent threads.<br>
• **Mark All as Read**: Fully implemented this missing feature by adding the necessary Room DAO queries, a Context extension, and a new menu option in the MainActivity toolbar.<br>
• **Notification Actions**: Fixed the "Mark as read" button in the notification bar to correctly dismiss unique OTP and Transaction notifications by passing their specific hash IDs to the MarkAsReadReceiver.<br><br>
**4. Privacy, Security & Optimization**<br>
• **Privacy-focused Debugging**: Added a "Enable Debug Logs" toggle under Security settings. All sensitive transaction and OTP logs are hidden by default.<br>
• **Broadcast Security**: The `org.fossify.messages.TEST_SMS` ADB testing command is now strictly restricted and only works when Debug Logs are enabled.<br>
• **Size Optimization**: Reduced the final APK size by ~1.5MB by using `localeFilters` to strip out all non-essential language resources, keeping only English and major Indian languages (Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam).<br>
• **Unlocked Premium Features**: Removed the purchase requirement and "locked" labels for Blocked Numbers and Blocked Keywords settings.<br>
• **Removed Monetization Prompts**: Completely hid the "Purchase Fossify Thank You" item from the General Settings to provide a cleaner, fully open-source experience (there is occassional pop up to buy and during first run).<br>
